\section{ICV Class Taxonomy}\label{vehicletaxonomy}

\subsection{Nationality-Based Mapping}

\subsubsection{Relation between Nations and Locations}
To reveal the differences in ICV security across countries of manufacture, we analyzed the distribution of vulnerabilities across different modules in ICVs from various nations.
As shown in Table~\ref{tab: locationplus}, ICVs manufactured in China account for the vast majority of all recorded vulnerabilities (88.6\%).
This is largely due to the lack of unified and mature standards for ICV production, with many regulations still in trial stages, leading to heterogeneous network architectures and protection mechanisms across manufacturers.
In contrast, vulnerabilities in American vehicles are predominantly concentrated in in-vehicle components (such as ECUs and IVIs), accounting for as much as 89.3\%, with almost no cloud platform vulnerabilities.
German ICVs exhibit a more balanced distribution, with 59.4\% of vulnerabilities involving cloud platforms and APPs, and 40.6\% tied to in-vehicle systemsâ€”indicating simultaneous emphasis on internal and external system protection.

\subsubsection{Relation between Nations and Types}
From a vulnerability type perspective (Table~\ref{tab: typeplus}), authorization issues dominate across all nations but are especially prominent in Chinese ICVs (36.87\%), suggesting persistent challenges in access control and identity verification.
Chinese vehicles also show high instances of information leakage (104) and injection vulnerabilities (73), indicating gaps in secure data handling and input sanitization. German vehicles present a more distributed type profile, though authorization flaws remain primary.
In contrast, American vehicles, despite having fewer total vulnerabilities, show a high proportion of information leakage (75\%), highlighting concerns with data exposure and insufficient boundary protections.
These patterns reflect differing priorities and levels of cybersecurity maturity among ICV-producing nations.


With the highest proportions observed in Small SUVs (37.6\%) and Compact Cars (35.0\%).
This suggests that remote connectivity services are more widely deployed in smaller vehicles, thereby exposing them to greater risks associated with cloud infrastructure.
The IVI system dominates in most size categories, particularly in Standard SUVs and Small SUVs, where it accounts for 42.2\% and 49.5\% of the respective vulnerabilities.
This highlights the high degree of IVI integration in these models, making it a primary attack target.

APP vulnerabilities are mainly concentrated in mid-size and large cars, which tend to incorporate richer mobile application features such as remote control and user interaction.
As vehicle size increases, the proportion of ECU-related vulnerabilities rises significantly, for example, Standard SUVs report 13.0\% of their vulnerabilities in the ECU module, compared to just 4.3\% in Small SUVs. This trend reflects the growing complexity of system architectures in larger vehicles, resulting in a broader attack surface.
Notably, the ``-'' category represents cross-size vulnerabilities, with a large concentration in cloud platforms (140 cases).
This indicates that different ICV types may share a unified cloud service architecture, thereby introducing systemic risks across platforms.

\subsection{APP class}

The app in the competition is the default app provided by the car manufacturer, developed in Java, and serves informational and entertainment functions, such as a car owner forum and remote door unlocking.
herefore, we are unable to categorize the app. 
However, we can classify the 66 app vulnerabilities we have collected into two categories: the first category includes vulnerabilities within the app itself, such as car mileage information leakage and arbitrary account password login; the second category involves vulnerabilities that affect vehicle safety, such as the ability to control the vehicle's unlocking.
As shown in Table ~\ref{APP Table}, it can be observed that while the car manufacturer has implemented some protection for communication between the app and the car, they have overlooked the app's security, leading to vulnerabilities such as owner information leakage and arbitrary account logins.
Therefore, car manufacturers should not only focus on the app's security during communication with the car but also pay attention to the app's full lifecycle security, from the development phase to the usage phase, in order to avoid common basic errors during the development stage, such as information leakage (27),  unauthorized accessing (19), and unvalidated inputs(Command injection (6), SQL injection (1)).
